            Inferred return types.
            Fixes issue 143.
            I eventually decided that it was wrong for the subtype's method
            to affect the supertype's method, since this will make incremental
            compilation a lot harder in the long run.

            In AmbiguateProperties, invert the related type relationship, by
            considering subclasses and implementors (down) instead of superclasses
            and implemented interfaces (up). This has two advantages:
    
            - The 'independent of' relationship is simplified, because we only
              need to consider whether the related types intersect.
    
            - We can account for 'multiple inheritance', which is a practical
              issue because of interfaces.
    
            Note that the 'up' relationship allows us to easily find common
            ancestors while the 'down' relationship allows us to easily find
            common descendants -- and this is what we care about for ambiguation.
