    Fixed an event resetting issue in ODE.
    
    When several discrete events occur during the same ODE integration step,
    they are handled chronologically or reverse chronologically depending on
    the integration direction. If one of the event truncates the step (for
    example because its eventOccurred method returns RESET or
    RESET_DERIVATIVES for example), the stepAccepted method of the pending
    events later in the step were not called. This implied that in the next
    step, these events were still referring to data from previous step, they
    had lost synchronization with the integrator.
