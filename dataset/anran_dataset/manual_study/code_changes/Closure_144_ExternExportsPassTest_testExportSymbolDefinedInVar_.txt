            Inferred return types.
            Fixes issue 143.
            I eventually decided that it was wrong for the subtype's method
            to affect the supertype's method, since this will make incremental
            compilation a lot harder in the long run.

            fix a regression caused by a change in the ordering in which
            constant folding is done.
            parts of PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax will crash if they
            see a NEG node with a NUMBER child.
            They were assuming that FoldConstants would fold these into one node.

            More debug diffing improvements: convert unique globally unique names
            to locally unique names for reproduciblity.

            be dropped silently if it gets pulled into a --manage_closure_dependencies
            build.

            ExternExports test now emits type annotation for exported externs.
                    - Changed ExternExportsPass to generate the externs as an AST and then print
            to a String rather than ad hoc with a StringBuilder.
                    - Changed TypedCodeGenerator to generate '*' (AllType) for parameters with unknown types rather than '?' (UnknownType) since '?' is not valid JSDoc.

            Tweak to PureFunctionIndentifier to propagate the side-effects for
            anonymous function expressions like: (Date.now||function(){return
            +new Date})()
