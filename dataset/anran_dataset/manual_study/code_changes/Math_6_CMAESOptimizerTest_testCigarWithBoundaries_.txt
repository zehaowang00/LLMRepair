commit 5f1b2dfe73a57ebc4e416e7a3fd41bb8bfa8cc98
Author: Gilles Sadowski <erans@apache.org>

    MATH-867
    Previous commit was missing a crucial modification (in the "repair" method),
    an inconsistency which entailed the failing of some tests.
    With that modification (thanks to Nikolaus Hansen), it was established that
    the "encode" and "decode" steps were indeed useless. This commit thus removes
    them, and all the code that was necessary only because of those two methods.
    Finite and infinite can now be freely mixed.
    Unit tests that depended on those limitations were also removed (thus also
    the one that was added following MATH-865).
