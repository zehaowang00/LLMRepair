    Fixes #205.
    
    Fix to @InjectMocks which injected incorrectly when multiple fields
    of the same type could be injected into, but only supplying 1 mock.
    This makes sure that whenever there are multiple type candidates,
    it will hold off injecting if it finds a different field which has the correct matching name.
