            when injecting param checks, do not inject them before any function
            declarations, because that will break normalization constraints.

            our mechanism for injecting boilerplate does not work
            for code that uses @const externs. So just don't use
            any @const externs.

            Fixes issue 182.

            Separate pass instance for peephole preprocessing.
            Now that I'm writing instructions for how people can add their own
            peephole passes, I want to make sure that the preprocessing
            peephole optimizations that relies on don't get disturbed.
