commit a8a456b183c9600658bcb0c72091bae1a30a4fda

    Improve detection of suspicious block comments.
    
    Doesn't fix issue 1037. That would require a regex that matches more
    comments, and there would be spurious matches.
    We only care about tags that would be recognized in a jsdoc:
    either a tag following /*, or a tag in a line with a * followed by spaces.
