    The MethodCompilerPass was being a little too smart for itself, leading
    to incorrect behavior by the InlineGetter pass (inlining extern
    definitions of functions which it thought were empty functions). This
    results in slight worse behavior by the depreciated "MethodCheck" pass,
    but most projects have moved on to "check_types" which is on by default. (John)
