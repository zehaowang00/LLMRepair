This is not handled in the LocaleUtils.toLocale method if it is meant to be the inversion method of Locale.toString().</p>\n\n<p>The fix for the ticket 328 does not handle well the case \"fr__P\", which I found out during fixing the first bug.</p>\n\n<p>I am attaching the patch for both problems.</p>"
