For example : fr__POSIX</p>\n\n<p>This string can be produced with the JDK by instanciating a Locale with an empty string for the country : new Locale(\"fr\", \"\", \"POSIX\").toString(). According to the javadoc for the Locale class a variant is allowed with just a language code or just a country code.</p>\n\n<p>Commons Configuration handles this case in its PropertyConverter.toLocale() method. I'd like to replace our implementation by the one provided by LocaleUtils, but our tests fail due to this case.</p>"
