The toString() method in ToStringBuilder.java is the entry point for building the string representation of an object. The code snippet provided is the end part of the toString() method where the final string is being constructed. If the object is null, the code appends the style's nullText. Otherwise, it appends the end of data indicator. This is the critical part where the bug related to thread local memory leak could potentially occur."

The method throws an IllegalArgumentException if the length of the input string is not 2, 5, or less than 7, which is not the expected behavior according to the bug report."
