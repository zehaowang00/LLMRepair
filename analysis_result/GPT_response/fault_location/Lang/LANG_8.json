The method 'getInstance' in the 'FormatCache' class is responsible for creating a formatter instance using the specified pattern, time zone, and locale. The bug occurs when the 'format' instance is created using 'createInstance' method and then put into the 'cInstanceCache' map. If another thread has already put a value for the same key, the 'format' instance is replaced with the previous value. This behavior leads to incorrect handling of time zones, which is the root cause of the bug described in the bug report."
